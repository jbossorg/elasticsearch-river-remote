===============================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/searchisko/elasticsearch-river-remote.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/searchisko/elasticsearch-river-remote)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/searchisko/elasticsearch-river-remote/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/searchisko/elasticsearch-river-remote)

The Universal remote system indexing River Plugin allows index documents from
remotely accessible systems into [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org). 
It's implemented as Elasticsearch [river](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/rivers/current/index.html) 
[plugin](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-plugins.html) 
and uses remote APIs (REST with JSON for now, but should be REST with XML, SOAP etc.) to obtain documents 
from remote systems. You can use it to index web pages from website also.

**Please note that Rivers are going to be [deprecated from Elasticsearch 1.5](https://www.elastic.co/blog/deprecating_rivers).**  

In order to install the plugin into Elasticsearch 1.3.x, simply run: 
`bin/plugin -url https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public-jboss/org/jboss/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-river-remote/1.5.4/elasticsearch-river-remote-1.5.4.zip -install elasticsearch-river-remote`.

In order to install the plugin into Elasticsearch 1.4.x, simply run: 
`bin/plugin -url https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public-jboss/org/jboss/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-river-remote/1.6.8/elasticsearch-river-remote-1.6.8.zip -install elasticsearch-river-remote`.

For info about older releases, detailed changelog, planned milestones/enhancements and known bugs see 
[github issue tracker](https://github.com/searchisko/elasticsearch-river-remote/issues) please.

The river indexes documents with comments from remote system, and makes them searchable
by Elasticsearch. Remote system is pooled periodically to detect changed documents and 
update search index. The river supports few modes with full and incremental updates to cover distinct types of REST APIs.

River can be created using:

	curl -XPUT localhost:9200/_river/my_remote_river/_meta -d '
	{
	    "type" : "remote",
	    "remote" : {
	        "urlGetDocuments"       : "https://system.org/rest/document?docSpace={space}&docUpdatedAfter={updatedAfter}",
	        "getDocsResFieldDocuments"  : "items"
	        "username"              : "remote_username",
	        "pwd"                   : "remote_user_password",
	        "timeout"               : "5s",
	        "spacesIndexed"         : "ORG,AS7",
	        "spaceKeysExcluded"     : "",
	        "indexUpdatePeriod"     : "5m",
	        "indexFullUpdatePeriod" : "1h",
	        "maxIndexingThreads"    : 2,
	    },
	    "index" : {
	        "index"                    : "my_remote_index",
	        "type"                     : "remote_document",
	        "remote_field_document_id" : "id",
	        "remote_field_updated"     : "updated",
	        "fields" : {
	            "title"   : {"remote_field" : "fields.title"},
	            "created" : {"remote_field" : "fields.created"},
	            "updated" : {"remote_field" : "fields.updated"},
	            "content" : {"remote_field" : "fields.body"}
	        }
	    },
	    "activity_log": {
	        "index" : "remote_river_activity",
	        "type"  : "remote_river_indexupdate"
	    }
	}

The example above lists all the main options controlling the creation and behavior of a Remote river. Full list of options with description is here:

* `remote/spacesIndexed` comma separated list of keys for remote system spaces to be indexed. Optional, list of spaces is 
   obtained from remote system if omitted (so new spaces are indexed automatically).
* `remote/spaceKeysExcluded` comma separated list of keys for remote system spaces to be excluded from indexing if list is 
   obtained from remote system (so used only if no `remote/spacesIndexed` is defined). Optional.
* `remote/indexUpdatePeriod`  time value, defines how often is search index updated from remote system. Optional, default 5 minutes. 
   You can use `0` here to disable incremental updates and perform only full updates controlled by any of next two params. 
   This configuration is ignored for `listDocumentsMode` which do not support incremental updates. 
* `remote/indexFullUpdatePeriod` time value, defines how often is search index updated from remote system in full update mode. 
   Optional, default 12 hours. You can use `0` to disable automatic full updates. Full update updates all documents in search 
   index from remote system, and removes documents deleted in remote system (not present in REST API responses) from search index also. 
   This brings more load to both remote system and Elasticsearch servers, and may run for long time in case of remote systems with many documents. 
   Incremental updates are performed between full updates as defined by `indexUpdatePeriod` parameter.
* `remote/indexFullUpdateCronExpression` contains [Quartz Cron Expression](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-1.x/tutorials/crontrigger) 
   defining when is full index update performed. Optional, if defined then `indexFullUpdatePeriod` is not used. Available from version 1.5.3.
* `remote/maxIndexingThreads` defines maximal number of parallel indexing threads running for this river. Optional, default 1. This setting influences load on both JIRA and Elasticsearch servers during indexing. Threads are started per JIRA project update. If there is more threads allowed, then one is always dedicated for incremental updates only (so full updates do not block incremental updates for another projects).
* `remote/remoteClientClass` class implementing *remote system API client* used to pull data from remote system. See dedicated chapter later. Optional, *GET JSON remote system API client* used by default. Client class must implement [`org.jboss.elasticsearch.river.remote.IRemoteSystemClient`](/src/main/java/org/jboss/elasticsearch/river/remote/IRemoteSystemClient.java) interface.
* `remote/listDocumentsMode` defines indexing mode for one space, so how *List Documents* URL of remote system is called to obtain all necessary data from it. Available values are `updateTimestamp`, `pagination`, `simple`, see description later in *Remote system API to obtain data from* chapter. Optional, default value is `updateTimestamp`.
* `remote/simpleGetDocuments` deprecated from 1.5.3, use `remote/listDocumentsMode` with `simple` value instead.
* `remote/minGetDocumentsDelay` defines a delay before the next request is made. So each get documents request will first wait this amount of time before actually executing. Basically it's a very simple throttling mechanism for the river. It is defined in milliseconds number.
* `remote/forcedIndexingPauseField` some REST API providers tend to add a field to response content specifying how much you have to wait before making another call to their service. Therefore the indexer need to parse this field and wait the given amount of time. Important note here is that if this pausing parameter is sent only once and not repeated in parallel responses then river with multiple threads processing might still break due to a thread race. In this situation it's recommended to use only one thread for processing, set in `remote/maxIndexingThreads` variable. By default the time is expected to be provided as milliseconds long number. In order to change the time unit please refer to `remote/forcedIndexingPauseFieldTimeUnit` description.
* `remote/forcedIndexingPauseFieldTimeUnit` it specifies time unit used by `remote/forcedIndexingPauseField`. Available options are [java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/TimeUnit.html) enum values e.g. 'SECONDS', 'MINUTES', 'MILLISECONDS'. By default the time is assumed to be in milliseconds.
* `remote/*` other params are used by the *remote system API client*
* `index/index` defines name of search [index](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/glossary.html#glossary-index) where documents from remote system are stored. Parameter is optional, name of river is used if omitted. See related notes later!
* `index/type` defines [type](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/glossary.html#glossary-type) used when document from remote system is stored into search index. Parameter is optional, `remote_document` is used if omitted. See related notes later!
* `index/field_river_name`, `index/field_space_key`, `index/field_document_id`, `index/fields`, `index/value_filters` are used to define structure of indexed document. See 'Index document structure' chapter.
* `index/remote_field_document_id` is used to define field in remote system document data where unique document identifier is stored. Dot notation may be used for deeper nesting in document data.
* `index/remote_field_updated` is used to define field in remote system document data where timestamp of last update is stored - timestamp may be formatted by ISO format or number representing millis from 1.1.1970. If the date is in other format use `index/remote_field_updated_format` to define it. Dot notation may be used for deeper nesting in document data. Timestamp is mandatory unless you use `simpleGetDocuments` mode.  
* `index/remote_field_updated_format` is an optional field which defines format of date given in `index/remote_field_updated`. You can use standard date formatting pattern supported by [JodaTime's DateTimeFormatter class](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/DateTimeFormat.html). Additionally you can use values of {unixEpoch} or {millisecondsEpoch} to define that date is given in seconds or milliseconds number accordingly since Epoch.
* `index/remote_field_deleted` is used to define field in remote system document data where deleted flag is stored. If this flag is set to the value configured in `index/remote_field_deleted_value` config param, then document is deleted from elasticsearch index even during incremental updates.
* `index/remote_field_deleted_value` defines value of deleted flag (see description of previous config property) which means that document is deleted (case sensitive string comparison is used).
* `index/comment_mode` defines mode of issue comments indexing: `none` - no comments indexed, `embedded` - comments indexed as array in document, `child` - comment indexed as separate document with [parent-child relation](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/mapping/parent-field.html) to the document, `standalone` - comment indexed as separate document. Setting is optional, `none` value is default if not provided.
* `index/comment_type` defines [type](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/glossary.html#glossary-type) used when issue comment is stored into search index in `child` or `standalone` mode. See related notes later!
* `index/field_comments`, `index/comment_fields` can be used to change structure comment information in indexed documents. See 'index document structure' chapter.
* `index/remote_field_comments` is used to define field in remote system document data where array of comments is stored. Dot notation may be used for deeper nesting in document data.
* `index/remote_field_comment_id` is used to define field in remote system's comment data where unique comment identifier is stored. Used if `comment_mode` is  `child` or `standalone`. Dot notation may be used for deeper nesting in document data.
* `index/preprocessors` optional parameter. Defines chain of preprocessors applied to document data read from remote system before stored into index. See related notes later!
* `activity_log` part defines where information about remote river index update activity are stored. If omitted then no activity information are stored.
* `activity_log/index` defines name of index where information about remote river activity are stored.
* `activity_log/type` defines [type](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/glossary.html#glossary-type) used to store information about remote river activity. Parameter is optional, `remote_river_indexupdate` is used if omitted.

Time value in configuration is number representing milliseconds, but you can use these postfixes appended to the number to define units: `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, `h` for hours, `d` for days and `w` for weeks. So for example value `5h` means five fours, `2w` means two weeks.
 
To get rid of some unwanted WARN log messages add next line to the [logging configuration file](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-configuration.html) of your Elasticsearch instance which is `config/logging.yml`:

	org.apache.commons.httpclient: ERROR

And to get rid of extensive INFO messages from index update runs use:

	org.jboss.elasticsearch.river.remote.SpaceByLastUpdateTimestampIndexer: WARN


Notes for Index and Document type mapping creation
--------------------------------------------------
Configured Search [index](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/glossary.html#glossary-index) 
is NOT explicitly created by river code. You have to [create it manually](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-create-index.html) 
BEFORE river creation.

	curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/my_remote_index/'

Type [Mapping](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html) for document 
is not explicitly created by river code for configured document type. The river 
REQUIRES [Automatic Timestamp Field](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-timestamp-field.html) 
and `keyword` analyzer for `space_key` and `source` fields to be able to correctly remove documents deleted in remote system from index 
during full update!
You have to use `keyword` analyzer for field where remote document id is stored (which is `document_id` by default) also 
if you use deletes during incremental updates (`remote_field_deleted` config field).   
So you have to create document type mapping manually BEFORE river creation, with next content at least:

	curl -XPUT localhost:9200/my_remote_index/remote_document/_mapping -d '
	{
	    "remote_document" : {
	        "_timestamp" : { "enabled" : true },
	        "properties" : {
	            "space_key" : {"type" : "string", "analyzer" : "keyword"},
	            "document_id" : {"type" : "string", "analyzer" : "keyword"},
	            "source"    : {"type" : "string", "analyzer" : "keyword"}
	        }
	    }
	}
	'

Same apply for 'comment' mapping if you use `child` or `standalone` mode!

	curl -XPUT localhost:9200/my_remote_index/remote_document_comment/_mapping -d '
	{
	    "remote_document_comment" : {
	        "_timestamp" : { "enabled" : true },
	        "properties" : {
	            "space_key" : {"type" : "string", "analyzer" : "keyword"},
	            "document_id" : {"type" : "string", "analyzer" : "keyword"},
	            "source"      : {"type" : "string", "analyzer" : "keyword"}
	        }
	    }
	}
	'

You can store [mappings in Elasticsearch node configuration](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-conf-mappings.html) alternatively.

See next chapter for description of indexed document structure to create better mappings meeting your needs. 

If you use update activity logging then you can create index and mapping for it too:

	curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/remote_river_activity/'
	curl -XPUT localhost:9200/remote_river_activity/remote_river_indexupdate/_mapping -d '
	{
	    "remote_river_indexupdate" : {
	        "properties" : {
	            "river_name"  : {"type" : "string", "analyzer" : "keyword"},
	            "space_key"   : {"type" : "string", "analyzer" : "keyword"},
	            "update_type" : {"type" : "string", "analyzer" : "keyword"},
	            "result"      : {"type" : "string", "analyzer" : "keyword"}
	         }
	    }
	}
	'

Remote system API to obtain data from 
-------------------------------------

###Support for data deletes
River supports correct update of search indices for two basic types of data deletes in remote system. 

If deleted data simply disappear from the remote system API responses then they are deleted from search index at the end of next full 
update. It is not possible to catch this type of deletes during incremental updates.

If deleted data are marked by some flag only and correctly timestamped to be returned by your system in next incremental update request, then 
you can use `remote_field_deleted` and `remote_field_deleted_value` river config params to point river to this flag and delete data from search 
index even during incremental update. Configured delete flag is reflected during full update also. 
This feature is available from 1.6.2 version of the river.

**Note:** You have to correctly set analyzers for some fields in mapping to allow correct deletes from search index, 
see previous chapter!     

###Remote system API requirements
Remote river uses these operations to obtain necessary data from remote system.

####List Spaces
This operation is used to obtain list of Space keys from remote system. 
Each Space is then indexed independently, and partially in parallel, by the river.
Space key is passed to the "List documents" operation so remote system can return documents for given space. 

This operation is optional, `remote/spacesIndexed` configuration parameter can be used to define fixed set of space keys if you do not want to read them dynamically.

If your remote system do not support Space concept, you can define `remote/spacesIndexed` configuration with 
one value only representing all documents, and then ignore `spaceKey` request parameter for next operations.    

####List Documents
This operation is used by indexer to obtain documents from remote system for one space and store them into search index. 
You can use one of three modes depending on your remote system API capabilities. 

##### List Documents mode `simple` 
You can use this mode if your remote system API has no capability for other modes or always returns reasonable amount of data. 
"List Documents" operation is called only once per indexing in this case and it is expected it return all documents.

Incremental update is not possible in this mode, full update is performed always.

Operation MUST accept and correctly handle these request parameters if provided by indexer: 

* `spaceKey` - remote system MUST return only documents for this space key (always provided by indexer)

##### List Documents mode `pagination`
You SHOULD use this mode if your remote system API list operation supports pagination to 
restrict number of documents returned from one call of this operation (ideal number is between 10 and 100 documents). 
Indexer calls list operation multiple times and sets `startAtIndex` request parameter accordingly to obtain 
all available documents. 

Incremental update is not possible in this mode, full update is performed always.   

Operation MUST accept and correctly handle these request parameters if provided by indexer: 

* `spaceKey` - remote system MUST return only documents for this space key (always provided by indexer)
* `startAtIndex` - remote system MUST return only documents matching previous criteria, and starting at this index in result set (0 based, always provided by indexer).

Operation MUST return these results:

* `documents` - list of documents with information to be stored in search index reflecting `startAtIndex` param. Unique identifier must be present in the data for each document.
* `total count` - total number of documents for indexing. Use of this feature is optional, if provided then indexing finishes when given number of indexed documents is reached. 
  If not used then indexing is finished when `documents` list is empty.


##### List Documents mode `updateTimestamp`
This is most advanced mode which allows to do incremental updates to decrease load on your remote system.
You SHOULD use this mode if your remote system API list operation supports both filtering and ordering by 'last document update' timestamp. 
Number of documents returned from one call of this operation is not restricted, but ideal value is between 10 and 100 documents. 
Indexer calls the operation multiple times and sets request parameters accordingly to obtain all necessary documents 
for both full and incremental update.   

Operation MUST accept and correctly handle these request parameters if provided by indexer: 

* `spaceKey` - remote system MUST return only documents for this space key (always provided by indexer)
* `updatedAfter` - remote system MUST return only documents updated at or after this timestamp (whole history if this param is not provided by indexer)
* `startAtIndex` - remote system MUST return only documents matching previous two criteria, and starting at this index in result set (0 based). 
   Support for this feature by remote system is optional, and is used only if remote system is able to return "total" count of matching documents in response. 
* `indexingType` - `full` or `inc` identifying full or incremental indexing run
* `updatedBefore` - remote system MUST return only documents updated at or before this timestamp.
   This parameter is working only if `remote/updatedBeforeTimeSpanFromUpdatedAfter` configuration option is provided, see below.


Operation MUST return these results:

* `documents` - list of documents with information to be stored in search index. Unique identifier and 'last document update' timestamp 
  must be present in the data. Returned list MUST be ascending ordered by timestamp of last document update!
* `total count` - total number of documents matching space and timestamp criteria (but given response may contain only part of them).
  Use of this feature is optional, some bulk updates in remote system may be missed if not used (because pooling is based only on updated 
  timestamp only in this case). If used then remote system MUST handle `startAtIndex` request parameter. 

####Get Document Details
This operation may be optionally used by indexer to obtain details for each indexed document. 
Is used when "List Documents" operation do not provide all information necessary for indexing.
This operation is called once for each item from list returned from "List Documents" call.
Note that this type of indexing requires lots of remote system calls, so due performance reasons it is 
better to return all necessary data directly in List Documents" response if possible.  

URL for each item MUST be provided in data returned from "List Documents" operation, or have to be constructed 
from document identifier provided there.

Data returned from this call are stored into document structure under `detail` key, so you can map them into search index then.

###Remote system API clients
You can use remote API clients provided by the river to use distinct remote system access technology and protocols, 
or you can create a new one by implementing [`org.jboss.elasticsearch.river.remote.IRemoteSystemClient`](/src/main/java/org/jboss/elasticsearch/river/remote/IRemoteSystemClient.java) interface.

####GET JSON remote system API client
This is default remote system client implementation provided by river. 
Uses http/s GET requests to the target remote system and handles JSON response data. 
Configuration parameters for this client type:

* `remote/urlGetDocuments` is URL used to call *List Documents* operation from remote system. You may use four placeholders in this URL to be replaced by parameters required by indexing process as described above: `{space}`, `{startAtIndex}`, `{updatedAfter}`, `{indexingType}`, `{apiKey}`
* `remote/getDocsResFieldDocuments` defines field in JSON data returned from `remote/urlGetDocuments` call, where array of documents is stored. If not defined then the array is expected directly in the root of returned data. Dot notation may be used for deeper nesting in the JSON structure.
* `remote/getDocsResFieldTotalcount` defines field in JSON data returned from `remote/urlGetDocuments` call, where total number of documents matching passed search criteria is stored. Dot notation may be used for deeper nesting in the JSON structure. 
* `remote/urlGetDocumentDetails` is URL used to call *Get Document Details* operation from remote system.
   You may use these placeholders in this URL to be replaced by parameters required by indexing process as described above:
  * `{id}` - identifier of document we need details for. Value is obtained from field named in `index/remote_field_document_id` in data item returned by *List documents* operation. 
  * `{space}` - identifier of space document is for 
* `remote/urlGetDocumentDetailsField` allows to name field in item's data returned from *List documents* operation to get URL used to call *Get Document Details* operation from.
* `remote/username` and `remote/pwd` are optional login credentials to access documents in remote system. HTTP BASIC authentication is supported. Alternatively you can store password into separate JSON document called `_pwd` stored in the rived index beside `_meta` document, into field called `pwd`, see example later.
* `remote/embedUrlApiKeyUsername` and `remote/embedUrlApiKey` are optional credentials to embed an api key in the `remote/urlGetDocuments` field. Alternatively, you can store the api key in a separate JSON document called `_pwd` stored in the rived index beside `_meta` document. It is suggested that you use text that matches `remote/embedUrlApiKeyUsername` for the username, see example later.
* `remote/timeout` time value, defines timeout for http/s request to the remote system. Optional, 5s is default if not provided.
* `remote/urlGetSpaces` is URL used to call *List Spaces* operation from remote system. Necessary if `remote/spacesIndexed` is not provided.
* `remote/getSpacesResField` defines field in JSON data returned from `remote/urlGetSpaces` call, where array of space keys is stored. If not defined then the array is expected directly in root of returned data. Dot notation may be used for deeper nesting in the JSON structure.
* `remote/headerAccept` defines value for `Accept` http request header used for REST calls. Optional, default value is `application/json`. 
* `remote/updatedAfterFormat` - an optional format definition for `updatedAfter` request parameter date so that it's compatible with the remote system.
   Allowed here are formats as specified by YodaTime library, please check http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/DateTimeFormat.html for reference.
   Additionally there are two special formats with values of `{unixEpoch}` and `{milisecondEpoch}`(default setting) which refer to the number of seconds and milliseconds respectively from epoch.
* `remote/updatedAfterInitialValue` - an optional initial datetime value for `updatedAfter` request parameter date. It should be provided as milliseconds since epoch value.
   If not provided the `updatedAfter` parameter will start with no value.
* `remote/httpMethod` - an optional parameter with the default value of `GET`. It defines HTTP method used for requesting documents from the remote system.
  The only alternative value for this parameter is `POST` which gathers all URL parameters and sends them as POST parameters instead of GET.
* `remote/updatedBeforeTimeSpanFromUpdatedAfter` - an optional parameter which enables you to constrain time window for the query executed in REST call. As a result you
  can use the optional `{updatedBefore}` request parameter in the URL which will be replaced dynamically before each call with a value of `updatedAfter`+`updatedBeforeTimeSpanFromUpdatedAfter`.
  This parameter value has to be provided as a long number of milliseconds defining the time difference between `updatedAfter` and `updatedBefore`.

Password can be stored outside of river configuration by using:

	curl -XPUT localhost:9200/_river/my_remote_river/_pwd -d '{"pwd" : "mypassword"}'

The API key can be stored outside of river configuration by using (use `remote/embedUrlApiKeyUsername` as the key name below):

	curl -XPUT localhost:9200/_river/my_remote_river/_pwd -d '{"embedUrlApiKeyUsername" : "apikey"}'

####Website indexing remote system API client
This remote client allows you to index content of html website pages. 
List of url's for webpages to be indexed is obtained from [sitemap](http://www.sitemaps.org) file. 
HTML content of webpages can be indexed 'as is', or you can configure advanced mapping with use of css 
selectors and html tags stripping. Class of this client is `org.jboss.elasticsearch.river.remote.GetSitemapHtmlClient`.
 
Configuration parameters for this client type:

* `remote/urlGetSitemap` is URL used to obtain sitemap from. Sitemap can be in [`sitemap.xml`](http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html) 
  format (plain xml with `.xml` or gzip compressed with `.gz` file extension), or it can be text file (`.txt` extension) with one url 
  at each line, or feed file in rss or Atom format. [crawler-commons](http://code.google.com/p/crawler-commons) `SiteMapParser` code is used as base there. 
  Note that this parser validates URL's provided in sitemap, and keeps only URL's from same domain where sitemap.xml is served from!
  Only documents with `Content-Type` `text/html` are processed.  
* `remote/username` and `remote/pwd` are optional login credentials to access webpages. HTTP BASIC authentication is supported. 
  Alternatively you can store password into separate JSON document called `_pwd` stored in the rived index beside `_meta` document, 
  into field called `pwd`, see example later.
* `remote/timeout` time value, defines timeout for http/s request to the remote system. Optional, 5s is default if not provided.
* `remote/htmlMapping` is optional mapping of html content into data, where you can use css selectors and html stripping. See examples later.

Password can be stored outside of river configuration by using:

	curl -XPUT localhost:9200/_river/my_remote_river/_pwd -d '{"pwd" : "mypassword"}'

When you use this remote client, you must set some configurations of the river to defined values: 

* `remote/spacesIndexed` always set to one string as this client doesn't support document spaces, eg. `MAIN` 
* `remote/remoteClientClass` always set to `org.jboss.elasticsearch.river.remote.GetSitemapHtmlClient`
* `remote/listDocumentsMode` always set to `simple` 
  (full update is done each time when indexing runs).
* `index/remote_field_document_id` always set to `id` as this field is provided by the remote client 
* `index/fields` must be used to store informations about webpage into search index. Information about 
  webpage provided by this remote client contains fields:
	* `url` - url of webpage loaded from sitemap
	* `id` - unique id of webpage (created from `url`)
	* `last_modified` - timestamp of page last modification if provided in `sitemap.xml`
	* `priority` - priority from `sitemap.xml` if provided there
	* `detail` - text with full HTML of the page (not sanitized any way!) or structure with more fields if `remote/htmlMapping` config is used. See examples later.

Note that you can still apply preprocessors to the data provided by the client, before they are stored into search index. 

Example river configuration to index whole HTML content only:

````
{
    "type" : "remote",
    "remote" : {
        "remoteClientClass"     : "org.jboss.elasticsearch.river.remote.GetSitemapHtmlClient",
        "urlGetSitemap"         : "http://test.org/sitemap.xml",
        "timeout"               : "5s",
        "spacesIndexed"         : "MAIN",
        "listDocumentsMode"     : "simple",
        "indexUpdatePeriod"     : "1h",
        "maxIndexingThreads"    : 1
    },
    "index" : {
        "index"                    : "test_website_index",
        "type"                     : "web_page",
        "remote_field_document_id" : "id",
        "fields" : {
            "url"     : {"remote_field" : "url"},
            "content" : {"remote_field" : "detail"}
        }
    }
}
````

Example river configuration to index parts of HTML as separate fields and run daily at 23:00:

````
{
    "type" : "remote",
    "remote" : {
        "remoteClientClass"     : "org.jboss.elasticsearch.river.remote.GetSitemapHtmlClient",
        "urlGetSitemap"         : "http://test.org/sitemap.xml",
        "timeout"               : "5s",
        "spacesIndexed"         : "MAIN",
        "listDocumentsMode"     : "simple",
        "indexUpdatePeriod"     : "0",
        "indexFullUpdateCronExpression" : "0 0 23 * * ?"
        "maxIndexingThreads"    : 1,
        "htmlMapping"           : {
            "title"       : {"cssSelector" : "head title", "stripHtml" : true},
            "description" : {"cssSelector" : "head meta[name=description]", "valueAttribute" : "content"},
            "content"     : {"cssSelector" : "body #content-wrapper", "stripHtml" : true},
            "html"        : {}
        } 
    },
    "index" : {
        "index"                    : "test_website_index",
        "type"                     : "web_page",
        "remote_field_document_id" : "id",
        "fields" : {
            "url"           : {"remote_field" : "url"},
            "title"         : {"remote_field" : "detail.title"},
            "description"   : {"remote_field" : "detail.description"},
            "content"       : {"remote_field" : "detail.content"},
            "complete_html" : {"remote_field" : "detail.html"}
        }
    }
}
````

`remote/htmlMapping` configuration section contains structure where key is name of field in detail, and value is another structure with two fields:

* `remote/htmlMapping/*/cssSelector` optional field which allows to define [css selector](http://jsoup.org/cookbook/extracting-data/selector-syntax) to extract defined part from the HTML content and store it into detail field. Whole HTML content is stored if not defined.
* `remote/htmlMapping/*/valueAttribute` you can use this optional config field to define name of attribute to take value from if html element is selected by`cssSelector`.
* `remote/htmlMapping/*/stripHtml` optional boolean field (default `false`). If set to `true` then all html tags are removed from value before it is stored into detail field, so only plain text is preserved there.


Indexed document structure
--------------------------
You **HAVE TO** explicitly configure which fields from document obtained from remote system will be available in search
index and under which names. `index/fields` configuration structure is used for this. 
You can also use `index/value_filters` to change structure of more complicated data before stored into search index (remove or rename some nested data elements).
See [`remote_river_configuration_default.json`](/src/main/resources/templates/remote_river_configuration_default.json) 
and [`river_configuration_example.json`](/src/main/resources/examples/river_configuration_example.json)
file for example of river configuration, and dedicated chapter later.

Remote River writes JSON document with following structure to the search index
for remote document. Remote document structure **MUST** provide unique identifier to be used
as document [id](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/glossary.html#glossary-id) in 
search index, so river can update data during subsequent indexing runs. You can configure field name in remote data, 
where id is stored, using `index/remote_field_document_id` configuration.
You can use dot notation to obtain deeper nested data from remote document.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Array of comments is taken from document structure from field defined in `index/remote_field_comments` configuration. 
Remote River uses following structure to store comment information into search index.
Comment id is taken from field configured in `index/remote_field_comment_id` and is used as document 
[id](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/glossary.html#glossary-id) 
in search index in `child` or `standalone` mode.

### How to map data into index by `index/fields`, `index/comment_fields` and use `index/value_filters` there

Example configuration is available [here](/src/main/resources/examples/river_configuration_example.json).

`index/fields` and `index/comment_fields` configuration shares same structure which is:

````
{
    "name_of_field_in_search_index" : {"remote_field" : "name_of_data_field_in_remote_document", "value_filter" : "name_of_value_filter"},
    ... other fields
}
````

Dot notation may be used in `remote_field` value to obtain deeper nested value from remote data. 

`value_filter` is useful when value from remote data is not simple, but is more complicated structure, and you want to change it a bit (remove or rename some items). 
It is optional and can be used only if necessary. It contains name of value filter defined in `index/value_filters` configuration (it allows reuse of same filter for more fields in data).

`index/value_filters` structure contains definitions of distinct value filters. It is:

````
{
    "name_of_filter" : {
        "name_of_field_in_remote_data"        : "name_of_field_in_search_index",
        "name_of_second_field_in_remote_data" : "name_of_second_field_in_search_index",
        ... mapping of other remote data fields to be included in search index
    },
  ... other filters
}
````

Example of mappings of remote data into search index with use of value filter:

Remote data:

````
{
  "meta" : {
    "name" : "my document",
    "qualification" : "public"
  }, 
  "created_by" : {
    "user" : "jdoe",
    "full_name" : "John Doe",
    "age" : "21"
  }
}
````

River configuration:

````
{
  ...
  "index" : {
    "fields" : {
      "title"  : {"remote_field" : "meta.name"},
      "author" : {"remote_field" : "created_by", "value_filter" : "user_filter"}
    },
    "value_filters" : {
      "user_filter" : {
        "user"      : "username",
        "full_name" : "full_name"
      }
    }
  }
}

````

Data in search index:

````
{
  "title" : "my document",
  "author" : {
      "username" : "jdoe",
      "full_name" : "John Doe" 
  } 
}
````

### Use of data preprocessors

You can also implement and configure some preprocessors, which allows you to 
change/extend document information loaded from remote system and store
these changes/extensions to the search index. 
Preprocessors are executed just after data are loaded from remote system, before they are mapped into search index. 
This allows you for example to perform value normalizations by lookup into other search indices, to create some index 
fields with values aggregated from more document fields, to add some constant values into data etc.

Framework called [structured-content-tools](https://github.com/searchisko/structured-content-tools) 
is used to implement these preprocessors. Example how to configure preprocessors is available 
[here](/src/main/resources/examples/river_configuration_example.json).
Some generic configurable preprocessor implementations are available as part of 
the [structured-content-tools framework](https://github.com/searchisko/structured-content-tools).

Index structure creation is implemented by [org.jboss.elasticsearch.river.remote.DocumentWithCommentsIndexStructureBuilder](/src/main/java/org/jboss/elasticsearch/river/remote/DocumentWithCommentsIndexStructureBuilder.java)

Management REST API
-------------------
Remote river supports next REST commands for management purposes. Note 
`my_remote_river` in examples is name of the remote river you can call operation
for, so replace it with real name for your calls.

Get [state info](/src/main/resources/examples/mgm/rest_river_info.json) about
the river operation:

	curl -XGET localhost:9200/_river/my_remote_river/_mgm_rr/state

Stop remote river indexing process. Process is stopped permanently, so even
after complete elasticsearch cluster restart or river migration to another 
node. You need to `restart` it over management REST API (see next command):

	curl -XPOST localhost:9200/_river/my_remote_river/_mgm_rr/stop

Restart remote river indexing process. Configuration of river is reloaded during 
restart. You can restart running indexing, or stopped indexing (see previous command):

	curl -XPOST localhost:9200/_river/my_remote_river/_mgm_rr/restart

Force full index update for all document spaces:

	curl -XPOST localhost:9200/_river/my_remote_river/_mgm_rr/fullupdate

Force full index update of documents for Space with key provided in `spaceKey`:

	curl -XPOST localhost:9200/_river/my_remote_river/_mgm_rr/fullupdate/spaceKey

Force incremental index update for all document spaces:

	curl -XPOST localhost:9200/_river/my_remote_river/_mgm_rr/incrementalupdate

Force incremental index update of documents for Space with key provided in `spaceKey`:

	curl -XPOST localhost:9200/_river/my_remote_river/_mgm_rr/incrementalupdate/spaceKey

List names of all Remote Rivers running in ES cluster:

	curl -XGET localhost:9200/_remote_river/list
